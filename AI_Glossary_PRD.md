# Product Requirements Document (PRD) â€“ AI Glossary

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
**Build a lightweight, client-side AI glossary that makes complex AI terms instantly accessible to developers, students, and tech enthusiasts.**

**Core Value:** Search â†’ Find â†’ Understand AI concepts in seconds, not minutes.

---

## ðŸš€ Prototype Goals (30-60 min build)
- **Primary:** Functional search + term display
- **Secondary:** Basic filtering by category
- **Success:** User can search "neural network" and get a clear definition

---

## ðŸ‘¤ Key User Flows

### Flow 1: Quick Search (Primary)
1. User lands on page â†’ sees search box prominently
2. Types "transformer" â†’ sees filtered results instantly
3. Clicks term â†’ definition expands inline
4. **Result:** Question answered in <10 seconds

### Flow 2: Browse by Category (Secondary)
1. User clicks "Machine Learning" filter
2. Sees curated list of ML terms
3. Scans and clicks interesting terms
4. **Result:** Discovers related concepts organically

## ðŸ“‹ Content Structure
```javascript
// Sample data structure
{
  id: "neural-network",
  term: "Neural Network", 
  definition: "A computing system inspired by biological neural networks...",
  category: "Machine Learning",
  examples: ["Image recognition", "Natural language processing"]
}
```
